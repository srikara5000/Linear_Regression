Linear Regression using TensorFlow
The code implements a linear regression model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict housing prices from the California Housing dataset. The data is split into training, validation, and test sets, with features scaled using StandardScaler. A neural network with one hidden layer (30 neurons, ReLU activation) is trained for 20 epochs using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE). The model is evaluated on a test set, and predictions are made on new data. The learning progress is visualized with a plot of MSE over epochs.
